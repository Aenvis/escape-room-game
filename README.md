# Escape-room-game
Project in Unity
==========================
<br>
The game is developed in Unity, we used such extensions/freamworks as Unity Input System, Cinemachine, DOTween, Extenject.
We made the game from scratch. All 3D models, textures, sounds, scripts are made by our team. 
<br>
The game features a Game Events system based on scriptable objects, quests based on scriptable objects, a simple interaction system, and equipment created specifically for our game. 
<br>
This architecture allows us to easily add new things to the game.

**Gameplay:**
=========================
It's not really a game but rather a tech demo that integrates our own systems, graphics and music. There's no plot or game loop as such, only show off of interactions and graphics. Game can be finished though, by finding the last door and going into the "void"
<br>
If you hover over an object it will highlight it, and if you additionally click E you will add it to your inventory. You can open any door, watch animations on the monitors and listen to sounds (such as dripping water). To open one of the doors you will need a wrench. And to fix a malfunctioning machine you will have to insert a fuse in the right place.
Finally, you will exit through the last door into the void.

**Controls:**
=========================
<br>
WASD - movement
<br><br>
SPACE - jump
<br><br>
E - interaction

**Team:**
