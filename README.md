# Escape-room-game
Project in Unity
==========================
<br>
The game was developed in Unity, we used extensions/freamworks such as Unity Input System, Cinemachine, DOTween, Zenject.
The game was made from scratch. Almost every 3D model, texture, sound and script has been made by our team. 
<br>
The game features a Game Events system based on scriptable objects, quest system based on scriptable objects, simple interaction system, and equipment created specifically for our game. 
<br>
Architecture and systems design allow us to easily add new elements to the game.

**Gameplay**
=========================
It's not really a game but rather a tech demo that integrates our own systems, graphics and music. There's no plot or game loop as such, only display of working interactions and graphics. Game can be "finished" though, by finding the last door and going into the "void".
<br>
If you hover over an object it will highlight it, and if you additionally click E you will add it to your inventory. You can open any door, watch error /correct effects on the screens (created via custom shaders) and listen to the sounds (such as dripping water). To open one of the doors you will need a wrench. And to fix a malfunctioning machine you will have to insert a fuse in the right place.

**Controls**

<br>
WASD - movement
<br><br>
SHIFT - sprint
<br><br>
SPACE - jump
<br><br>

**Team**
